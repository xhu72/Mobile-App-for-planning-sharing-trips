1. Describe the problem:

Planning group trips can be chaotic and inefficient. People often struggle to coordinate dates, share itineraries, manage bookings, and stay updated on changes. Communication is usually scattered across multiple apps (e.g., chats, maps, booking platforms), making it hard to stay organized and ensure everyone is on the same page.

2. Propose the Solution

We propose a mobile app that allows users to collaboratively plan, organize and share trips. The app would let users create trip itineraries, assign roles such as planner, driver, vote on options (like destinations or activities) and manage shared expenses. Real-time updates, notifications, and calendar integration would keep everyone informed and connected throughout the trip planning process.
