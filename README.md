# Mobile-App-for-planning-sharing-trips

1. Describe the problem:

Planning group trips can be chaotic and inefficient. People often struggle to coordinate dates, share itineraries, manage bookings, and stay updated on changes. Communication is usually scattered across multiple apps (e.g., chats, maps, booking platforms), making it hard to stay organized and ensure everyone is on the same page.
