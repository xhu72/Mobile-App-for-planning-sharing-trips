# Team Working Agreement

Welcome to our team! We, as a development team, commit to following this working agreement for the duration of the project.

---

## 1. Work Cadence
•⁠  ⁠*Sprints*: We work in 3-week sprints, starting on Mondays and ending on Fridays.  
•⁠  ⁠*Sprint Planning*: Held at the start of each sprint to define sprint goals and commit to deliverables.  
•⁠  ⁠*Daily Stand-ups*: 15-minute stand-up meetings held at 10:00 AM daily to share:  
  - What I did yesterday  
  - What I’m doing today  
  - Any blockers  
•⁠  ⁠*Sprint Review*: Held at the end of each sprint to demo completed work.  
•⁠  ⁠*Sprint Retrospective*: Held after the review to reflect and improve our process.  

---

## 2. Collaboration & Communication
•⁠  ⁠We use GitHub for code collaboration and issue tracking.  
•⁠  ⁠We communicate via WhatsApp, and check messages at least twice daily.  
•⁠  ⁠All decisions (technical or process-related) must be documented in the team notes or shared doc.  
•⁠  ⁠When someone is unavailable (sick, vacation, etc.), they must notify the team in advance.  

---

## 3. Coding Standards & Development Workflow
•⁠  ⁠All work must be linked to a user story in the backlog.  
•⁠  ⁠Code must follow agreed-upon style guides, with consistent formatting and naming conventions.  
•⁠  ⁠All commits must be pushed to a feature branch and go through a pull request (PR).  

*Pull Requests (PRs) must be:*  
•⁠  ⁠Reviewed by at least one other team member.  
•⁠  ⁠Merged only after passing all automated tests and manual checks.  
•⁠  ⁠We do not commit directly to the main branch.  

*Branch naming convention:*  
•⁠  ⁠⁠ feature/<task-name> ⁠  
•⁠  ⁠⁠ bugfix/<issue> ⁠  
•⁠  ⁠⁠ hotfix/<description> ⁠

## 4. Definition of Done (DoD)
A task is considered done when:  
1.⁠ ⁠Acceptance criteria are met.  
2.⁠ ⁠Code is reviewed and approved.  
3.⁠ ⁠Tests are written and pass.  
4.⁠ ⁠The feature works on all intended platforms (iOS and Android).  
5.⁠ ⁠Documentation is updated (⁠ README ⁠, API).  
6.⁠ ⁠Related issues/PRs are closed.  
7.⁠ ⁠Team is notified.  

---

## 5. Task Management
•⁠  ⁠Tasks are created, assigned, and tracked using GitHub Projects.  
•⁠  ⁠We commit only to what we can realistically complete within the sprint.  
•⁠  ⁠If a task cannot be completed, it is discussed and either:  
  - Split into smaller parts, or  
  - Moved to the next sprint with updated estimates.  

---

## 6. Testing & Quality
•⁠  ⁠All features must be manually tested on Android and iOS before being marked as done.  
•⁠  ⁠Unit tests and integration tests must be written where applicable.  
•⁠  ⁠Bugs must be logged with clear steps to reproduce.  
•⁠  ⁠A bug reported during the sprint will be triaged immediately.  

---

## 7. Decision Making
•⁠  ⁠We aim for consensus, but in case of disagreement:  
  - Majority vote decides.  
  - If needed, defer to the professor.  
•⁠  ⁠All significant technical decisions are documented.  

---

## 8. Tools & Platforms
•⁠  ⁠*Code Repository*: GitHub  
•⁠  ⁠*CI/CD*: GitHub Actions  
•⁠  ⁠*Design/Mockups*: Figma  
•⁠  ⁠*Communication*: WhatsApp / Email  
•⁠  ⁠*Documentation*: Google Docs  
•⁠  ⁠*Issue Tracking*: GitHub Issues / Projects  

---

## 9. Respect & Culture
•⁠  ⁠We practice open communication and active listening.  
•⁠  ⁠Everyone's ideas are valued equally.  
•⁠  ⁠Constructive feedback is encouraged and delivered respectfully.  
•⁠  ⁠We ask for help when stuck — collaboration over isolation.  
•⁠  ⁠We support psychological safety — no blame, only solutions.  

---

## 10. Availability
•⁠  ⁠All members should commit 10–15 hours per week to this project (or as agreed).  
•⁠  ⁠If availability changes, the team must be informed.  
•⁠  ⁠No ghosting — communicate early and often.
