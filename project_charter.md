# Project Charter : Mobile-App-for-Planning-Sharing-Trips
# 1. Introduction  
Planning sharing trips can often be chaotic, with important details scattered across multiple appsâ€”chat platforms, maps, booking sites, and spreadsheets. This disorganization leads to miscommunication, missed bookings, budgeting confusion, and overall frustration. To address this, our team is developing a unified mobile solution: Mobile-App-for-Planning-Sharing-Trips, designed to streamline every stage of collaborative trip planning.

# 2. Overview
