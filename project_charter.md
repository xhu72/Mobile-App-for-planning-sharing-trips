# Project Charter : Mobile-App-for-Planning-Sharing-Trips

This disorganization leads to miscommunication, missed bookings, budgeting confusion, and overall frustration. To address this, our team is developing a unified mobile solution: Mobile-App-for-Planning-Sharing-Trips, designed to streamline every stage of collaborative trip planning.
