# Project Charter : Mobile-App-for-Planning-Sharing-Trips
# 1. Introduction  
Planning sharing trips can often be chaotic, with important details scattered across multiple appsâ€”chat platforms, maps, booking sites, and spreadsheets. This disorganization leads to miscommunication, missed bookings, budgeting confusion, and overall frustration. To address this, our team is developing a unified mobile solution: Mobile-App-for-Planning-Sharing-Trips, designed to streamline every stage of collaborative trip planning.

# 2. Overview  
2.1 Objective  
The key objectives of the Mobile-App-for-Planning-Sharing-Trips are:  
- To allow users to create and manage detailed trip itineraries.
- To support real-time collaboration by inviting friends and assigning planning roles.
- To integrate tools like maps, calendars, and bookings for a seamless travel experience.
- To track and split expenses fairly among group members.
- To offer offline access and media sharing for enhanced usability during trips.
- To provide a personalized, accessible interface for all types of travelers.
